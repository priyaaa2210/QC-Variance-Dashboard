# QC-Variance-Dashboard
The dashboard uses optimized data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive visuals to enable dynamic filtering and drill-down analysis. A Decomposition Tree is implemented to identify root causes of QC variance across multiple dimensions. Slicers and cross-filtering enhance user interaction and analytical depth.
